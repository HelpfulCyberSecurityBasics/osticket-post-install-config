<h1>osTicket - Post-Install Configuration</h1>
This tutorial outlines the post-install configuration of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Post-Install Configuration Objectives</h2>

- Configure Roles, Departments, and Teams: This involves structuring the support organization by defining agent permissions, departmental responsibilities, and team collaborations.
- Create Agent and User Profiles: This objective focuses on adding individual agents who will manage tickets and creating user accounts for customers to submit requests.
- Allow Anyone to Submit Tickets: By unchecking the "registration required" option, the system becomes accessible to all users, enabling them to create tickets without needing to log in.
- Set Up SLAs (Service Level Agreements): This ensures that different types of tickets are handled within specific timeframes, improving response and resolution efficiency
- Define Help Topics to Organize Incoming Requests: This categorizes tickets, making it easier to route them to the appropriate teams and streamline the support process.

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

1.  Accessing the osTicket Admin Panel:

- The first step involves logging into the osTicket admin panel using the admin user username and password created during osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation. This provides access to all the system's configuration settings.
